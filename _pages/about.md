I'm interested in how and why language changes, specifically the morphosyntax of Tibeto-Burman and Celtic languages. I use NLP tools to get more and better-annotated data from historical manuscripts (Handwritten Text Recognition) and endangered-language fieldwork (Automatic Speech Recognition).

In Cambridge term time, I co-organise the [Historical Linguistics Reading Group](https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/cambridge-histling).

I supervise graduate students who are interested in linguistic questions about morphosyntactic change and language documentation of endangered languages in Nepal. If you're interested in applying for a PhD with me in Cambridge, please send me an email with a brief description of your research question and planned methodology. 

Current and past PhD students and their topics:
- Sarah Gordon: Acquisition and change in the history of English and BSL
- Luca Gal: Language contact in evaluative morphology 
- [Anna Danilova](https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/annadanilovalinguist/home?authuser=0): Comparative syntax of converbs (adverbial participles)
- Nora Dehmke: Syntactic reconstruction of passives in Celtic
- Kitty Liu: Diachrony of clause chaining in Tibetic languages
