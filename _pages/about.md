I'm interested in *how and why languages change*, specifically the *morphosyntax of Tibeto-Burman and Celtic* languages. I use and develop NLP tools to get more and better-annotated data from historical manuscripts (Handwritten Text Recognition) and endangered-language fieldwork (Automatic Speech Recognition). In Cambridge term time, I co-organise the [Historical Linguistics Reading Group](https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/cambridge-histling). 

I'm currently involved in the following research projects:
- AHRC-funded `Emergence of Egophoricity' (Co-I with Prof Nathan Hill)
- CHRG-funded `Teaching materials for endangered languages' (PI)
- ELDP-funded [`An audio-visual archive of Dzardzongke'](https://www.elararchive.org/dk0666) (PI)
- ERC-funded [`PaganTibet'](http://www.pagantibet.com) (External Advisor)

I supervise graduate students who are interested in linguistic questions about morphosyntactic change and language documentation of endangered languages. If you're interested in applying for a PhD with me, please send me an email with a brief description of your research question and planned methodology. 

Current and past PhD students and their topics:
- Sarah Gordon: Acquisition and change in the history of English and BSL
- Luca Gal: Language contact in evaluative morphology 
- [Anna Danilova](https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/annadanilovalinguist/home?authuser=0): Comparative syntax of converbs (adverbial participles)
- Nora Dehmke: Syntactic reconstruction of passives in Celtic
- Kitty Liu: Diachrony of clause chaining in Tibetic languages
- Stephen Mulraney: Linguistic features of Old Tibetan
